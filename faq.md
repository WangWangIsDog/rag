# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is expected of me?

- To get a _satisfactory_ you have to turn in a research paper at the end of term 
(8 pages, plus references, [latex conference format](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn). 
- Paper must demonstrate a clear understanding of the field and identify some area where  current results are lacking and you might make a contribution. 
- Then you need to make the contribution. 
- Important note: you can fail in that goal and still get a "satisfactory" just as long as you fail in an insightful way after making a mature effort to work the problem.
